# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

# Symbol       Value
# I             1
# V             5
# X             10
# L             50
# C             100
# D             500
# M             1000

# For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together.
# Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. 

# The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
# However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. 
# Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. 

# There are six instances where subtraction is used:
# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
# Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

# Example 1:
# Input: "III"
# Output: 3

# Example 2:
# Input: "IV"
# Output: 4

# Example 3:
# Input: "IX"
# Output: 9

# Example 4:
# Input: "LVIII"
# Output: 58
# Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

# Example 5:
# Input: "MCMXCIV"
# Output: 1994
# Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
