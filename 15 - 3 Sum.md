Topic: array, sorting, two pointers

## Problem

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Solution

Problem is framed like the popular two sum where we find 2 values $(x, y)$ which add up to given target, which can be solved by finding if difference between target and value $(target - x)$ exists in array. 

However, here we are required to work with 3 values  $(x, y, z)$ and **find all triplets where sum of values is zero** $x+y+z=0$. This must be done without repeating the elements, though input array can contain duplicates.

This approach will only work with sorted array

### Pseudo

1. Sort array
2. Iterate through elements, setting current element as the pivot $x$. 
    1. if current value (lowest) is greater than zero, then this would indicate there are only non-negative elements, which cannot sum to 0.
    2. if current value is same as preceding (duplicate), then skip.
    3. Proceed to step 3
3. Use two pointer approach to compare values, starting with *left_ptr* at position $x+1$, and *right_ptr* at the end of the array or  $len(nums)$-1. We want to find all pairs whose sum is equal to 0, or $(x+y+z)=0$. 
    
    We will do so by creating separate function which essentially performs two-sum. Loop while *left_ptr* is smaller than *right_ptr*
    
    1. If $sum(x, y, z)$ is greater than 0, we will increment *left_ptr* 
    2. Elif $sum(x,y, z)$ is less than 0, we will decrement *right_pt*
    3. if sum is zero, meaning **triplet found,** add to results list. Increment left and decrement right. Increment left while while $left = left+1$, to skip duplicates.

            if nums[i-1] != nums[i] or i == 0:

        return triplets

        left = i + 1

        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

            
            #if sum > 0, increment left
            if total < 0:
                left += 1
            
            # if sum < 0, decrement right
            elif total > 0: 
                right -= 1
            
            else:
                # if sum is 0, add to triplets list
                triplets.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left-1]:
                    # skip duplicates
                    left += 1
